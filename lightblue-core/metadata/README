For testing json schemas just add a new json document in the appropriate test resource directory.
In src/test/resources directories named <schema>-json-schema-test-{invalid,valid} will have their
contents tested against the given <schema>.json file.  If the directory ends in "invalid" the test
will expect the json to be invalid against the schema.  If the directory ends in "valid" the test
will fail if the json doesn't validate against the schema.
